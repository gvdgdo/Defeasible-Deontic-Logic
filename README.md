# Implementation of Defeasible Deontic Logic in ASP (clingo).

This is the first working version of an ASP implementation of Defasible Deontic Logic. The implementation covers Obligations, Permisions, and Compensatory Obligations.  Currently the language is restricted to defasible rules (constitutive, prescriptive and permissive).
